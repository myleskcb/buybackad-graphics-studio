## 2026-08-28 — Program setup (Hermes)

Studied:
  Read DESIGN-LAW.md in full (42 rules, 680 lines) plus the app structure, to
  find where a curriculum should attach without repeating settled work.

Measured:
  - app.js 7,724 lines / ~560KB; index.html 955; styles.css 1,166
  - 243 templates in the library; 153 designer templates audited by the
    existing DESIGN-LAW work
  - Live site verified 200 at buybackad-graphics-studio.netlify.app
  - studio.scans.ad: record present on Netlify NS, absent from public DNS.
    Root cause: registrar delegation to Namecheap, Netlify zone not
    authoritative. Documented in OPERATIONS.md, needs registrar access.
  - reselling.us/GFX returns 200 but serves RU CRM v1, a different app.

Changed:
  - Committed and pushed 5,080 lines of uncommitted design-law work that had
    been sitting unbacked since the July 8 commit (c301fd4).
  - Added docs/: README, SESSION-PROTOCOL, CURRICULUM, COLOR-THEORY,
    FIELD-RESEARCH, OPERATIONS, and this log.

Rejected:
  - Teaching beginner colour theory. The project is already past it: OKLab
    colour maths, split-complementary accent derivation at ±160°, glyph-masked
    contrast, discord-band hue rules. The curriculum was rewritten to target
    the actual gaps (semantic colour, saliency ordering, CVD simulation,
    reflow regression) instead.
  - Changing DNS at the registrar. It moves a live product's records and is a
    human decision; documented both fix options instead.

RESUME HERE (superseded by the entry below):
  Module 3, gap 3 in COLOR-THEORY.md — simulate deuteranopia and protanopia
  over the 243-template library and re-run the existing contrast audit under
  each simulation. Any template that passes normally and fails simulated is a
  hidden defect. Start by locating the existing contrast audit entry point in
  app.js (search `HOUSE DESIGN LAW` and the COLOUR_FIX table), reuse its
  glyph-masking rather than writing a new sampler — bounding-box sampling is a
  known false-positive trap (bandKnockout: 1.21:1 bbox vs 12.06:1 masked).

## 2026-08-28 — Module 3, gap 3: colour-vision deficiency (Hermes)

Studied:
  Colour-vision deficiency as a legibility and commercial concern. Brettel/
  Vienot dichromacy simulation, and why it must run on LINEAR RGB via LMS for
  the same reason DESIGN-LAW rule 40 puts colour maths in a perceptual space.

Measured:
  All ten theme decks, accent against its own gradient start, normal vision vs
  protan/deutan/tritan simulation, WCAG contrast.

  - **Crimson x Mint: 5.26 normal -> 3.84 deuteranopia.** A red ground with a
    green accent, the one pairing deuteranopia collapses. It sits 151 degrees
    apart, squarely inside the band rule 41 approves, so it reads as a
    confident complementary choice and is the worst performer in the set for
    ~5% of men.
  - **Royal x Tangerine: 4.58 -> 4.15 protanopia.** Milder, but it started with
    no margin above 4.5.
  - Teal x Coral fails at 2.75 under NORMAL vision. Pre-existing, unrelated to
    CVD, found incidentally by the sweep. Not fixed — flagged.

  The headline finding: **hue harmony and CVD safety are independent.**
  Satisfying rule 41 says nothing about whether a pairing survives.

Changed:
  - DESIGN-LAW.md rule 43 appended (APPENDED, not spliced — rule 42).
  - scripts/cvd_audit.py — runnable, --json flag, exits 1 on failure so it can
    gate a deploy later.
  - docs/ study program added (README, SESSION-PROTOCOL, CURRICULUM,
    COLOR-THEORY, FIELD-RESEARCH, OPERATIONS, this log).

Rejected:
  - Repainting Crimson x Mint on the spot. Rule 14 is explicit that colour
    theory selects from the vocabulary the real references use, and no field
    research has been done yet to say what replaces mint. Measuring the defect
    and naming it is the finished unit of work; guessing a replacement is not.
  - Guessing template ground colours to audit COLOUR_FIX pairs. First attempt
    used invented hexes and produced numbers that contradicted the file's own
    measurements. Thrown away; the theme decks are authored flat colours and
    are the honest thing to measure without a canvas.
  - Changing scans.ad DNS at the registrar. See OPERATIONS.md.

RESUME HERE:
  Decide the fix for Crimson x Mint and Royal x Tangerine. Do the
  FIELD-RESEARCH.md sampling FIRST so the replacement hue comes from observed
  competitor ads rather than from taste — that is what rule 14 requires. Then
  extend cvd_audit.py from the ten theme decks to the 243 rendered templates,
  reusing the existing glyph-masked sampler in app.js rather than writing a new
  one.
